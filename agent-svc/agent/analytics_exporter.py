"""Background task that exports Valkey analytics counters as Prometheus metrics.

The exporter runs as a fire-and-forget background task inside agent-svc.
It periodically scans Valkey for ``analytics:counter:*`` keys and registers
each one as a Prometheus COUNTER metric with the ``groktocrawl_analytics_``
prefix.

The task is long-lived and re-reads all counters on each tick so that new
counters added by any service are picked up automatically.

Usage::

    # In app factory:
    app.state.task_tracker.create_background_task(
        start_analytics_exporter(redis_url="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0")
    )

    Iterates every *interval* seconds, reads all ``analytics:counter:*``

    Because Prometheus COUNTERs are monotonically increasing and Valkey
    counters only ever go up (via INCR), the absolute value is set on
    each tick via the counter's ``set()`` method.
