"""Valkey-backed response cache for crawled pages with maxAge/minAge semantics.

Cache keys are SHA-256 hashes of the URL. Each entry stores the full page
data dict (the raw scrape response from ``ScraperClient``) along with a
``cached_at`` timestamp and the ``ttl_ms`` value that was set when the entry
was created.

Key format: ``crawl:cache:{sha256(url)}``

Value format (JSON)::

    {
        "url": "https://example.com/page",
        "data": {"success": true, "data": {"markdown": "...", ...}},
        "cached_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
        "ttl_ms": 3600000
    }

The ``CrawlCache`` is checked by the ``CrawlEngine`` before each page scrape.
When a cache hit occurs and the entry is within ``maxAge``, the scraper call
is skipped entirely, saving network latency. When ``minAge`` is set, the
cache operates in cache-only mode: a cache miss returns an error rather than
fetching fresh content.
